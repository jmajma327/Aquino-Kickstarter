Kickstarter Analysis

Overview of Project

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to look at the success rates of these Kickstarter campaigns with relation to their launch dates and funding goals.

Analysis and Challenges

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

I analyzed the data in the Kickstarter campaign to focus on launch date. I created a pivot table where the focus was on parent category specifically theater. I also filtered the data by successful, failed, and canceled. Lastly. I filtered the years and months pf these campaigns. As result I created a Pivot Chart which represents the findings of the data.  I have included a link to the chart:      https://github.com/jmajma327/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/master/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png 
 


Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

I analyzed the data in the Kickstarter campaign to focus on Goals. I created a pivot table where I broke down goals into increments of 5,000. I also gathered and selected successful, failed, and canceled campaigns. Lastly, I was able to find the percentages of this data that was created. As a result, I created a line graph that represents the findings of this data. I have included a link to the chart: https://github.com/jmajma327/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/master/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png


Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I had a few difficulties along the way. The most significant was making sure the formula was correct when working in the COUNTIFS function. It was incorrect in various cells which made the graph incorrect.

Results

What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The fist conclusion that I came to after analyzing the data is that May and June  are  the best month to have a successful campaign. The second conclusion was that in the months of November, and December were not the best time to have a successful theater campaign. The amounts were significantly lower during this time.


What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

After I analyzed the data campaigns for plays are more successful if they have lower goals. The higher the goal better chances the campaign will fail.

What are some limitations of this dataset?

We could have more information on who is providing these funds for the campaigns.

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could have used different types of charts to represent the data. We could have also seen results of time throughout the years by adding another filter.
